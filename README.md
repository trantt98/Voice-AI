# Voice-Ai

The Goal of this repo is to explore different Machine Learning Models, which revolve around the human voice and to get a rough summary around existing frameworks. 
Usage of these Models in Terms of human voice is vast. To name a few Examples there are models like demucs(hybrid transformer), which are able to separate their audio files into their accoustic sources.(vocals,bass,drums and others) Or Tools like whisper from Open AI which can extract text from audio files. The reverse is also posiible with Text-to-Speech models (short TTS) which can generate voice samples with human characteristics based on given text. Examples on github are tortoise(tts),VITS(end-to-end tts) or tacotron(tts) from google.

For the start the so-vits-svc has been chosen to be explored. So-vits-svc is a model and stands for SoftVC VITS Singing Voice Conversion.
